    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p><storng>Pho</storng> is a traditional vietnamese soup and noodle dish that is also 
        enjoyed in other south east asian countries. It is comprised of a broth, rice noodles,
        herbs/vegetable, various types of meat, and condiments such as sriracha and houisin sauce. 
        Traditionally, the broth is made by boiling and simmering beef bones and oxtail over a long 
        time to make a bone broth. The hot broth is then poured over rice noodles and raw, thinly
        sliced pieces of beef. The heat of the broth cooks the beef and loosens the noodles to eating texture.
        The dish is then topped with the other aforementioned toppings. </p>
    <p>There are various types of pho which are usually characterized by the type of broth as well as the toppings 
        included in the dish. For example, <em>pho dac biet</em> or "combination pho" is simply pho with every possible
        topping available including things like tripe, meatballs, brisket, thin beef, etc. <em>Pho ga</em> or chicken
        Pho is pho whose broth and meat toppings are made with chicken instead of beef. The following recipe makes <em>pho tai</em>
        or pho with only thin beef. However, feel free to add whatever toppings or condiments you want to the recipe since most of 
        those additions are added at plating time and is key reason why pho is so modular and customizeable.
