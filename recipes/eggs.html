    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The following recipe describes how to make asian style crispy fried eggs.
        While traditional fried eggs involve cooking the eggs and low-medium heat until
        the whites are just set to maintain a soft texture, many street vendors in asian countries
        will cook eggs in woks on much higher temperatures with liberal amounts of oil in order to 
        get a crispy texture in on the whites while maintaining a runny/soft yolk.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 egg (or as many as you like)</li>
        <li>vegetable/olive oil</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
        <li>soy/seasoning sauce</li>
        <li>any toppings you would like</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add liberal amount of oil to pan and heat over medium-high</li>
        <li>Once hot, add egg to pan. Allow for whites to settle.</li>
        <li>When eggs start to sizzle and pop, tilt pan towards yourself and spoon
            hot oil onto whites such that whites get a bubbly texture on the yolk side.
        </li>
        <li>Continue until bottom of eggs are browned and yolk is to your desired texture.</li>
        <li>Plate with salt, pepper, and other seasonings/sauces.</li>
    </ol>
